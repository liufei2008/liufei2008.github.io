An example might be a torch, which consists of some static meshes and some lights. Prefabs allows you to create this kind of collection once, and then save it in as a Prefab asset. You can then select the Prefab in the Content Browser, and add it many times through the level.</p><p>Prefabs can have changes made to them in a level, and those changes can then be propagated to all existing instances of that Prefab. Because this uses Unreal&#39;s property system, only properties still at their original prefab defaults will be updated when the Prefab changes. For example, imagine you have a Prefab that contains a yellow light, and you then change one instance of the Prefab to have a blue light. Then you change the Prefab itself to have a green light. Only instances who&#39;s light is still yellow will have the color changed to green. This is very useful, as it allows you modify, or even remove, parts of a Prefab instance to make it fit a particular usage, but also receive updates to the Prefab.</p><h2 id="create-a-prefab" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#create-a-prefab" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Create a Prefab</h2><p>To create a new Prefab, first attach the actors to a single root actor in the level:<br><img src="'+d+'" alt=""> Then select the root actor, right-click on LGUI column and choose <strong>Create Prefab</strong> from the context menu.<br><img src="'+h+'" alt=""> Then a dialog window will show, you can choose a place and name to save the asset:<br><img src="'+p+'" alt=""> Click &quot;Save&quot; and then a Prefab asset will appear in content folder, and the actors of this prefab will show &quot;Prefab&quot; icon on the LGUI column:<br><img src="'+f+'" alt=""> Now we can delete the actors in level.
