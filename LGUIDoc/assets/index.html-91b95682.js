If LGUILifeCycleBehaviour is created from Prefab, then <strong>initialization work needs to be placed in Awake (not BeginPlay)</strong>, because Awake will execute after all prefab deserialization work is completed.<br><strong>OnEnable</strong>: Execute when GetIsActiveAndEnable of LGUILifeCycleBehaviour changes from false to true.<br><strong>Start</strong>: Execute Start before the first Update is executed.<br><strong>Update</strong>: When GetIsActiveAndEnable is true, it will be executed once every frame.<br><strong>OnDisable</strong>: Execute when GetIsActiveAndEnable of LGUILifeCycleBehaviour changes from true to false, or execute once before OnDestroy and OnEnable has been executed.<br><strong>OnDestroy</strong>: Execute once when LGUILifeCycleBehaviour is destroyed (EndPlay) and Awake has been executed.<br> Awake/Start/OnDestroy can be executed only once in the whole life cycle, and OnEnable/OnDisalbe/Update may be executed multiple times.<br> GetIsActiveAndEnable: Returns true when IsUIActive of UIItem is true and enable of LGUILifeCycleBehaviour is true.</p><p>Execute order with the UnrealEngine&#39;s built-in life cycle function: BeginPlay -&gt; Awake ...
