    "keywords": "TextAnimation Select a UIText actor, add \"UIEffectTextAnimation\" component: 1. TextAnimation Component Property: Functions: Selector Selector defines the method to select characters in text. Properties Properties defines which property will affect and how it affect. Execute Order See Common Effect Basically we use Selector to select range of characters in text, and use Properties to change character's property, then use a animation controller to Play Animation . Get example from This Project . 2. Selector Selector can collect information about which characters are selected, and 0 to 1 interpolation value from start to end, then provide these informations to Properties . There are 3 types of Selector: Range, Random, RichTextTag. Range selector defines start and end range of characters in UIText, and provide 0 to 1 value(for interpolation) from start to end. Property: Functions: Start Start character position from 0 to 1, 0 is first character of text, 1 is last one. End End character position from 0 to 1, 0 is first character of text, 1 is last one. Offset 0 means Properties will have no effect, 1 means Properties have full effect, and middle value is interplation. We can set this \"offset\" property to make animation. Range Selector can provide 0 to 1 value from start to end, but sometime Properties effect may look too smooth, so lower this value can let Properties effect more sharp. Flip Direction Selector can provide 0 to 1 value from start to end when this value is false, if it is true then 1 to 0 from start to end. Random selector will select characters randomly, and generate random value from 0 to 1 for interpolation. Property: Functions: Seed Random seed. Start Start character position from 0 to 1, 0 is first character of text, 1 is last one. End End character position from 0 to 1, 0 is first character of text, 1 is last one. Offset 0 means Properties will have no effect, 1 means Properties have full effect, and middle value is interplation. We can set this \"offset\" property to make animation. RichTextTag selector can select characters by rich-text custom-tag, and provide 0 to 1 value(for interpolation) from start to end. Property: Functions: Range Like the property in Range selector. Lower this value can let Properties effect more sharp. Tag Name Custom tag name Flip Direction Like the property in Range selector, flip 0-1 to 1-0. Offset 0 means Properties will have no effect, 1 means Properties have full effect, and middle value is interplation. We can set this \"offset\" property to make animation. 3. Properties Properties can use the information that passed from Selector , and apply property change to characters. There are many types of Properties: Alpha, Color, Position, Rotation, Scale, Position Random, Position Wave... The name is what it functional for. eg. Alpha can change transparency of characters. Property: Functions: Alpha Target alpha value, 0-1 range. Ease Type Animation type, same as LTween ease. Ease Curve Only valid if easeType = CurveFloat. Use CurveFloat to control the animation. ColorRandom can generate random color. Property: Functions: Seed Random seed Min Random min Max Random max Use HSV Conver color to HSV(Hue, Saturate, Value) and interpolate, then convert the result back. Interpolate two colors in HSV may look better. PositionWave can use a sin function to generate wave effect for characters. Property: Functions: Position Max position value for sin wave. Sin function generate values from -1 to 1, so the result will be from -position to position. Frequency Higher frequency will generate smaller wavelength. Speed Move speed of the wave. Flip Direction Flip move speed direction of the wave. We can use multiple properties to combine our specific effects, the effects will calculate from top to bottom: 4. PlayAnimation We can use build-in LGUIPlayTween component to control our animation. The key is call function SetSelectorOffset on UIEffectTextAnimation component."

First of all, copy material LGUI_Standard from LGUI Content folder (You may need to check Show Plugin Content if it is not visible). And paste it to your project content directory. Change the material node like the image below: Select a UIText, and drag the material you just modified to Custom Material slot: Now the text should look glow: Example 2, use texture to maskout our sprite. Note: UISprite render a UISpriteData. UISpriteData contains the info of a small area from a packed atlas texture. First of all, copy material LGUI_Standard from LGUI Content folder (You may need to check Show Plugin Content if it is not visible). And paste it to your project content directory.

Select LGUICanvas component from WorldSpaceUIRoot actor, in the Additional Shader Channels property, check on UV1 . Now the result should be good: Example 3, use rect-clip and texture-clip to clip our sprite. Let's start with the result of Example 2 . Open the copied material, find LGUIRectClip node from LGUI Content folder, and drag it to material editor window: Break original Opacity link, and link like the image below: Select LGUICanvas component from WorldSpaceUIRoot actor, change Clip Type to Rect : Now drag the UISprite actor to the edge of WorldSpaceUIRoot, see it is clipped: texture-clip is the same thing, just repace the LGUIRectClip with node LGUITextureClip :"

Draw order of elements UI elements in canvas are drawn by order of \"Depth\" property, which is a property of each UI elements. Larger \"Depth\" render on top of lower one. And there is a \"Sort Order\" property of LGUICanvas, \"Sort Order\" always have top priority then \"Depth\". Property: Functions: Render Mode The way the UI is rendered. Options are Screen Space Overlay and World Space and Render Target(Experimental) Sort Order This can affect draw order and raycast order of UI elements. Larger Sort Order will always draw on top of lower one, and larger one always receive raycast earlier then lower one. Pixel Perfect Screen Space Overlay mode only. This can avoid half-pixel render, make UI elements render precisely on pixel. Clip Type Control UI elements pixels visibility. The options are None and Rect and Texture , None means no clip at all, Rect means rectangle area clip, Texture means use a texture's alpha channel for clip. Dynamic Pixels Per Unit The amount of pixels per unit to use for dynamically created bitmaps in the UI, such as UIText. But!!! Do not set this value too large if you already have large font size of UIText, because that will result in extreamly large font texture! Additional Shader Channels Flags to enable/disable shader channels. Default only provide Position/Color/UV0, you can check Normal/Tangent/UV1/UV2/UV3 for your own use. Default Materials Default materials, for render default UI elements. Override Parameters For not root canvas, inherit or override parent canvas parameters. Lets learn by create a UI from scratch. 1. Create a LGUICanvas LGUICanvas must stay on a actor which have a UIItem as RootComponent. Create a new empty level, drag a UIContainerActor to viewport: Rename the UIContainer to \"RootCanvas\", set the \"LGUI Transform\" parameters like this (rotation:-90,0,90): Add a LGUICanvas component to \"RootCanvas\", notice a icon and a \"0\" appear beside \"RootCanvas\" in World Outliner: Move your mouse over the icon, a tooltip will appear: Right click on the down arrow button and choose \"Create UI Element\"->\"UISprite\": A new UISpriteActor will be created, see a white rectangle appear in viewport, and number of drawcall become 1 in \"RootCanvas\". Rename the UISpriteActor to \"Sprite\": Right click on the down arrow button and choose \"Create UI Element\"->\"UIText\": Rename the UITextActor to \"Text\", \"Color\" to black, \"Depth\" to 1. See \"New Text\" appear on viewport, and drawcall count become 2: 2. Use rect clip Select \"Sprite\", change width to 1920, height to 1080, see the white rectangle exceed canvas area: Select LGUICanvas component from \"RootCanvas\" actor, change \"Clip Type\" to \"Rect\", see the Sprite being clipped with canvas's rect area: LGUICanvas support hierarchy nested RectClip Lets add a sub canvas: create a UIContainer, name it \"SubCanvas\", add a LGUICanvas component to it. Then drag \"Sprite\" and \"Text\" to \"SubCanvas\" as children, now the hierarchy should be like this: And the \"Sprite\" is clipped by \"SubCanvas\" area: Change the \"SubCanvas\" with to 640, height to 360, drag it to see the clip effect: Select LGUICanvas from \"SubCanvas\" actor, see the sub canvas parameter is much less than the parent one. Acturally only the top-most canvas can show the full parameters, sub canvas will automatically inherit parent parameters . But we do have the chance to change sub canvas parameter, by check the \"Override Parameters\" flags: If we check \"ClipType\" flag, then the \"ClipType\" parameter will appear. Then we can set \"None\" clip to disable clip: 3. Default Materials Select LGUICanvas from \"RootCanvas\", expend \"Default Materials\" and 3 material appears: LGUICanvas use these 3 materials to render all UI elements, you can replace any of it with your own implemented material, eg: change shading model to receive light, add emissive glow."

The main differences of version 2.13.0 are: LGUISpriteData now inherit from LGUISpriteData_BaseObject , LGUISpriteData_BaseObject represent a base class and interface for a sprite-atlas-data, so we can implement our own packing method(eg: offline packing with mipmap support). Most of LGUI's default sprite-data variable now switch to LGUISpriteData_BaseObject , eg: UISprite and UISpriteSequencePlayer. So if there are compile errors related to LGUISpriteData , you may need to change variable type from LGUISpriteData to LGUISpriteData_BaseObject . LGUIFontData now inherit from LGUIFontData_BaseObject , LGUIFontData_BaseObject represent a base class and interface for a font-data, so we can implement our own character texture(eg: import font from Bitmap Font Generator ). UIText now use LGUIFontData_BaseObject . So if thare are compile errors related to LGUIFontData , you may need to change variable type from LGUIFontData to LGUIFontData_BaseObject ."

Double click to Open TweenAnimation blueprint, change \"Duration\" to 3.0. Add a \"Local Rotator To\" node like this: Hit play, the cube will move and rotate in viewport: Add a \"Local Scale To\" node like this, then hit play and see the animation: You can find other tween functions in \"LTween\" category: 2. Delay and Ease Delete \"Local Position X To\" and \"Local Scale To\" node, keep \"Local Rotator To\" node, and set \"Delay\" to 1.0, hit play (the animation will start after 1 seconds when play): LTween provides severial ease types, click \"Ease\" and select the type you want. This site could be a good reference about ease functions (image is also from site https://www.inkfood.com/tween-3d-objects/ ): CurveFloat There is a special ease type called \"CurveFloat\": This can let us use a CurveFloat to control our animation. The following steps will show you how to do it: Right click on empty area of Content, choose \"Miscellaneous\"->\"Curve\": Select \"CurveFloat\" in the popup window: Name it to \"AnimationCurve\": LTween will use horizontal range from 0 to 1, keep that in mind and make the curve to any type you want: Open \"TweenAnimation\" blueprint, drag out \"Return Value\" of \"Local Rotator To\" node, and add a new node \"Set Curve Float\", and choose \"AnimationCurve\" in \"New Curve Float\", this will make the CurveFloat work: 3. Loop Loop is one of the most important thing of a tween animation. After the \"Set Curve Float\" node, Drag out \"Return Value\" and add a new node \"Set Loop\": Click \"New Loop Type\" and you will find 4 options: Once - No loop Restart - Each loop cycle restarts from beginning Yoyo - The tween move forward and backward at alternate cycles Incremental - Continuously increments the tween at the end of each loop cycle (A to B, B to B+(A-B), and so on) Don't forget to set \"New Loop Count\", 0 or 1 means no loop, -1 means infinite loop, change these parameters and hit play. 4. Callback Callback function is also a can't-missing feature in tween animation. LTween provide these callbacks: OnStart - Execute when animation start (if have delay, then execute after delay) OnUpdate - Execute every frame if is tweening OnComplete - Execute when animation complete OnCycleComplete - Exeucte every cycle complete when use loop Setup callback function is easy. eg OnComplete, drag out the \"Return Value\" and add new node \"On Update\", drag out \"New Update\" and add a custom event, the event will execute as you want: Functions Pause/Resume - Pause/Resume this animation Kill/KillIfIsTweening - Kill the tween if the animation already start ForceComplete - Force complete this animation at this frame, call OnComplete Use LTween for Material LTween provide \"Material Vector Parameter To\" and \"Material Scalar Parameter To\" nodes for \"Material Instance Dynamic\" objects:"

Render 3D UI in world space by LGUI's renderer, so it will not affect by UE's post process, and LGUI's post process will work(eg. UIBackgroundBlur). Modify: LTween: LTweener's outer use binded UObject. Editor: Show a message if there are multiple ScreenSpaceUI, which is not allowed. UIStaticMesh more stable. LGUIPrefab: When click \"CreatePrefab\" or \"Apply\" button, other prefabs won't saved to current prefab. LGUIPrefab: Now use \"ActorGUID\" property as actor's key, so UE4.25 will not support anymore. Remove \"ComboBox\" and \"FlyoutMenu\". Remove \"ViewportUITexture\" and \"UITextureBox\". Show UIBaseActor's \"Actor\" and \"Rendering\" category. Add PriorityInScenViewExtension to renderer. Because LGUI's renderer use UE's view extension, so this value can help LGUI's renderer to sort with other view extensions, higher comes first. UIItem: Rename SetUIActive to SetIsUIActive , IsUIActiveSelf to GetIsUIActiveSelf , IsUIActiveInHierarchy to GetIsUIActiveInHierarchy . Rename LGUI_XXXRayEmiter to LGUI_XXXRayemitter. 2.14.3 Fix: SetCustomUIMaterial not working. Render order issue. RectClip not working in children canvas.

Currently it has been used for Niagara ParticleSystem Renderer for LGUI . Fix: MultiSample not working without post process. Improve: Optimize drawcall management, improve performance, reduce memory usage, minimize drawcall rebuild times. 2.13.2 Modify: Optimize UIGridLayout. Fix: DynamicPixelsPerUnit not working in world space UI. UISprite and UIText display wrong uv when atlas texture change. LGUICanvas: Drawcall sort incorrect in some case. 2.13.1 NewFeature: LGUIFont support UE4 build-in font, and support font's subface. Support 32-bit indexbuffer, default is off, turn it on by modify LGUI.Build.cs. Show tip text when indexbuffer out of range. Add SetScrollDelta and SetScrollValue for UIScrollView, so we can mannually scroll it. UICustomDepthMask component provide us the ability to mask out screen-space-UI with custom depth stencil. So that a character can stand before UI elements. Modify: Improve UIText render and memory. Fix: UIScrollView: Default created scrollview's scrollbar cannot interact. ThumbnailRenderer: Pure virtual call caused crash. 2.13.0 Notes: There maybe compile errors when update to this version, just follow this page to fix it.

UIItem: UI render not update when change pivot in editor. 2.12.7 NewFeature: Auto Manage Depth! (Experimental) Automatically manage UI element's depth and drawcall, so we don't need to set depth property. Just check autoManageDepth property in LGUICanvas to make it work. This property will be made to true by default in future release. Change anchor now can preserve relative UI position. Modify: Add Outer parameter for CreateLGUISpriteData function. Add SetMinValue SetMaxValue for UISlider. LGUICanvas now can pool material when rebuild drawcall. Add Fix it and Fix all button for LGUIPrefab if the prefab's version is older than current. Add Fix it button for UIItem if the UIItem's displayName not equal to actor label. Add Preview property for UISpriteSequencePlayer and UISpriteSheetTexturePlayer, so we can preview the sequence in editor. Add Project3DToScreen function for LGUICanvasScaler, so we can project a screen-space 3D UI element's position to screen-space 2D. Add hint text if there are multiple LGUIBaseRaycaster with similar parameter. Fix: UIItem: Anchor calculation wrong. UIDropdown: Update selections after SetValue . LGUICanvas: PixelPerfect not update properly. UITexture: If SetTexture with nullptr parameter then use default white texture. Editor: Focus to Screen-Space-UI now take consider the UI's fov angle. UIText: Render size now fit with screen size when LGUICanvasScaler scales canvas. 2.12.6 Modify: PrefabSystem Update! Now prefab can cook automatically. We don't need to Recreate the prefab if property field changed or version change, or any other reason. Adjust LGUIComponentReference's Get node in blueprint. Fix: Correct calculate the Clip-Rect-Offset property in LGUICanvas. UIDropdown's automatic pisition will take consider canvas's rect clip property. Enter/Exit event bubble not execute as expected when there is an empty UI-element(no enter/exit interface component) between the hierarchy. 2.12.5 NewFeature: Level editor camera focus and align to Screen-Space-UI by LGUI Tools or keyboard shotcut. Modify: Remake anchor calculation, now we can use SetRelativeLocation/Rotation instead of SetUIRelativeLocation/Rotation, and anchor will be calculated automatically. Fix: Crash caused by layout calculation(new calculation method in version 2.12.4). Fix compile error in source-build-engine version. 2.12.4 NewFeature: Add IncludeChildren parameter in FindChildByDisplayName and FindChildArrayByDisplayName function. Add Use8Direction property in UIEffectOutline. Add OwnerNoSee and OnlyOwnerSee property in LGUICanvas. Optimize anchor calculation in UIItem. Remove SetUIRelativeLocation(and similar SetUIXXX) function, instead use native SetRelativeLocation. Modify: Access dropdown in blueprint. Remove ClearEvent when switch left/right mouse button input.

Crash caused by UIScrollViewWithScrollbarComponent, when change Horizontal or Vertical after delete scrollbar. StaticMesh render issue when spawn from prefab. LGUIPrefab set initial transform fail. Crash caused by LGUIDrawableEvent, if assign different type of actor. 2.12.3 NewFeature: Add DisplayName property for UIItem, so we can use FindChildByDisplayName to find a child of provided name, and FindChildArrayByDisplayName to find child collection of same name. UIBackgroundBlur and UIBackgroundPixelate now support rect-clip and texture-clip. Add CanScollInSmallSize property in UIScollView, controls: when content size is smaller than it's parent size, can scoll it or not. Add callback event to UIToggleGroup. Add UnlinkPrefab function for LGUI Tools . Add Dropdown control, deprecate FlyoutMenu and ComboBox . Modify: Split out clip function from material. Texture clip use red channel as clip input. Editor: Confirm before delete prefab instance. Fix: UIBackgroundBlur not work in condition: upper actor have LGUICanvas (not root canvas), if turn the canvas off and on, then UIBackgroundBlur will not work. Directly set UIItem's position.z not work. Copy actor mark the actors not valid. Missing component when create from LGUI's prefab system. Turns out I put the component in wrong place. Text render with a tiny black edge when in small size. Nested canvas with rect clip, but sub canvas's clip value not update when position change. --Thanks to \"陈靖中\", he helped on debug/test/new-feature. 2.12.2 NewFeature: Add tween function MeshMaterialScalarPrameterTo/ MeshMaterialVectorParameterTo, directly set tween animation for MeshComponent's material.
